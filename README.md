# raspberrypiserverc
Little project of mine to create a server in C for the raspberry pi (and use the pins)

So atm it contains two projects, the server (in c) and the client (in java).
The server is written in c so it can eventually do things with the pins on a raspberry pi.
Now the idea is to control the pins from some sort of java application (or even an app)

So far, we've made a pi to arduino morse server/client in c, using a button and a beeper.

the plan:
-get the server to do a few different kinds of commands (without functionality).
-find out how the pins on the pi work, and acquire components to do things with.
-write an application in c to do a couple of things with the pins. (no server)
-update the server/client so the java client can do things with the pins.
-make a pretty java application.
-(make an app).
